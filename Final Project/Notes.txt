The first 40 covariates are about patient demographics, cytogenics, mutation status and the results of several standard blood tests.
The rest attributes are proteomic measurements of 231 antibodies' responses.

The gender and age and other basic information about the patient should be important.
I think the blood tests results are important (ABS BLST; BM.BLAST; BM.MONOCYTES; BM.PROM; PB.BLAST; PB.MONO; PB.PROM).
The 231 antibodies' responses can be largely constrained to maybe top 3-10 attributes.
